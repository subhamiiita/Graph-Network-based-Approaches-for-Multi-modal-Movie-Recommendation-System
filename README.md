# Graph-Network-based-Approaches-for-Multi-modal-Movie-Recommendation-System
- Bullet list
  A novel task of multi-modal video recommendation is introduced along with a first of its kind multi-modal movie dataset.
- Bullet list
Multi-modal features extracted from text, metadata, audio, video modalities of movies are utilized  for generating movie representation as well as user representation in an unsupervised way---this is unlike the existing approaches where user rating information are utilized for generating movie/user representations
Better representations of metadata and the description using knowledge graph-based embeddings.
